                    <li>I enjoy this game a lot, but I understand a few of the points made by the negative reviews. There is some waiting here and there in the early parts of many missions. So because of that, i'd say this is more of a laid back game that you play while also watching some tv that you only half-watch. Taking that into consideration, this is a very fun game, I definitely got my money's worth, and I could see myself coming back to it down the line when I want something relaxing to play.</li>
                    <li>So addictive, oddly relaxing, definitely worth more than it's currently selling for! Highly recommend bundling with DLC, adds a lot to the gameplay that is missing with the base game.</li>
                    <li>The simulation feels lacking, and there's a lot of waiting for rent to come in that you can't skip by speeding up time. The game also doesn't warn you before you exceed various limits, so instead of working on strategy, you have to watch for those hidden traps.</li>
